                The Career Training College is an approved provider of the government's ICT50220 Diploma of
                Information Technology course through Jobs and Skills WA, under the Participation â€“ Work
                Readiness program. Career Training College conducts numerous events every month for its students
                as part of the Job Ready Program. Until now, all participants' names have been manually recorded.
                As a result, the event manager has decided to keep a record of active participants as active members
                for these events. Active members will be registered by the event manager on the "Career Training
                College Event Team" website, based on the participants' interests. Since the members are listed in
                the website's system, it simplifies the process for the event manager to notify these members about
                any new updates or events.
